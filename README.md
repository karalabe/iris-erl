  Iris Erlang Binding
=======================

This is the official Erlang language binding for the Iris decentralized messaging framework. For details about Iris itself, please visit the [Iris website](http://iris.karalabe.com).

  Contributions
-----------------

Currently my development aims are to stabilize the project and its language bindings. Hence, although I'm open and very happy for any and all contributions, the most valuable ones are tests, benchmarks and actual binding usage to reach a high enough quality.

Due to the already significant complexity of the project (Iris in general), I kindly ask anyone willing to pinch in to first file an [issue](https://github.com/karalabe/iris-erl/issues) with their plans to achieve a best possible integration :).

Additionally, to prevent copyright disputes and such, a signed contributor license agreement is required to be on file before any material can be accepted into the official repositories. These can be filled online via either the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://iris.karalabe.com/icla) or the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://iris.karalabe.com/ccla).
