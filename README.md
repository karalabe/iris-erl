  Iris Erlang binding
=======================

This is the official Erlang language binding for the Iris cloud messaging framework. If you are unfamiliar with Iris, please read the next introductory section. It contains a short summary, as well as some valuable pointers on where you can discover more.

  Background
-------------------

Iris is an attempt at bringing the simplicity and elegance of cloud computing to the application layer. Consumer clouds provide unlimited virtual machines at the click of a button, but leaves it to developer to wire them together. Iris ensures that you can forget about networking challenges and instead focus on solving your own domain problems.

It is a completely decentralized messaging solution for simplifying the design and implementation of cloud services. Among others, Iris features zero-configuration (i.e. start it up and it will do its magic), semantic addressing (i.e. application use textual names to address each other), clusters as units (i.e. automatic load balancing between apps of the same name) and perfect secrecy (i.e. all network traffic is encrypted).

You can find further infos on the [Iris website](http://iris.karalabe.com) and details of the above features in the [Core concepts](http://iris.karalabe.com/book/core_concepts) section of [The book of Iris](http://iris.karalabe.com/book). For the scientifically inclined, a small collection of [papers](http://iris.karalabe.com/papers) is also available featuring Iris.

There is a growing community on Twitter [@iriscmf](https://twitter.com/iriscmf), Google groups [project-iris](https://groups.google.com/group/project-iris) and GitHub [project-iris](https://github.com/project-iris).

  Installation
----------------

To add the dependency, modify _rebar.config_:

    {deps, [
      % ...
      {iris, ".*", {git, "https://github.com/project-iris/iris-erl.git"}}
    ]}.

To get the package:

    rebar get-deps

Refer to it as _iris_.

  Quickstart
--------------

The first step to using Iris through this binding is setting up a local _relay_ _node_ through which to send messages, and connecting to it using the current library. Detailed infos in [The book of Iris: Run, Forrest, Run](http://iris.karalabe.com/book/run_forrest_run).

A demo presentation is also available, touching on all the features of the library through a handful of challenges and their solutions. The recommended version is the [playground](http://play.iris.karalabe.com/talks/binds/go.slide), containing modifiable and executable code snippets. A [read only version](http://iris.karalabe.com/talks/binds/go.slide) is also available.

  Contributions
-----------------

Currently my development aims are to stabilize the project and its language bindings. Hence, although I'm open and very happy for any and all contributions, the most valuable ones are tests, benchmarks and actual binding usage to reach a high enough quality.

Due to the already significant complexity of the project (Iris in general), I kindly ask anyone willing to pinch in to first file an [issue](https://github.com/project-iris/iris-erl/issues) with their plans to achieve a best possible integration :).
